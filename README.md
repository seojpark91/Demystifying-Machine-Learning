# Demystifying Machine Learning

## Introduction and Motivation

This repository is to record my learning journey of machine learning. Instead of just trying to sort things out in physical notes (half of them gone after I cleaned my room - one of the main reasons why I decided to start this repository), I decided to uploada learning journal at least 2-3 times a week.

I am starting with the basics of deep learning simply because this is the one I'm learning right now. I hope to cover most of key machine learning models and concepts. Yes, this will be a long journey. Let me know if there is any mistakes in my contents. Any feedback is deeply appreciated.
